# This program generates a visualization of the Mandelbrot set, a mathematical set of complex numbers that exhibit complex behavior under certain operations. The code also includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to change the colormap of the plot, a slider widget that allows the user to adjust the maximum number of iterations used to calculate the Mandelbrot set, and buttons that allow the user to zoom in and out on the plot or reset the plot. The features are only interative if the code is ran in a separate Python environment. The plot is generated using the matplotlib library, and the dropdown menu and buttons are implemented using the ipywidgets and matplotlib.widgets libraries.
